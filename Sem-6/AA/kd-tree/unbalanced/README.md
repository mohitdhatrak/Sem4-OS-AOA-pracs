# KD Tree - unbalanced

## Code implementation
- same level of indentation (or same level of vertical line) means those nodes are at the same level in the tree
- each child node is connected to its parent node shown by a vertical line
- left or right child mentioned for each node

###  Sample input values = [[3, 6], [17, 15], [13, 15], [6, 12], [9, 1], [2, 7], [10, 19]]
